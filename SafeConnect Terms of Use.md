# SAFECONNECT APPLICATION TERMS OF USE

**Last Modified: January 23, 2024**

These Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) apply to the use of the SafeConnect web application and any of its companion applications available on web and mobile platforms (collectively, the “**App**”) and the related services (collectively with the App, the “**Services**”).  The Services are provided by Parasol Cooperative Foundation (“**Parasol**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”), and these Terms represent a binding agreement between you as the user of the Services (“**user**,” “**you**” or “**your**”) and Parasol.  By downloading, installing or using the App and accessing or using the Services, you confirm your acceptance of these Terms and our associated Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Terms.  If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately uninstall the App and discontinue its use and the use of any Services. 

NOTICE:  THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, MASS ACTION WAIVER, AND A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY. PLEASE REVIEW SECTIONS 16 THROUGH 18 BELOW BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR USING THE APP OR SERVICES.

## 1. Description

The App is a trauma-informed case management and care coordination tool that allows organizations—and the survivors they work with—to communicate, schedule meetings, and share information and documents in a discreet and safe manner. 

The App includes both the Organizational Case Management Application and the Client Companion Application.

The Organizational Case Management Application is available only on the web, and it will allow an organization’s users to: (1) manage a survivor’s case and the data within it; (2) schedule and log interactions with survivors; (3) share information between team members about a survivor’s case; and (4) triage information with other partner organizations. The users of an organization may include—but are not limited to—administrators, advocates, and volunteers.

The Client Companion Application is available on both web and mobile platforms and will allow a user to: (1) reference their safety plan; (2) schedule appointments with any organization where they are registered to receive support; and (3) store and share documentation with organizations to enhance their service support. The Client Companion Application is separate from the Organizational Case Management Application but will interface with such application seamlessly to allow for information to be shared safely with the user of the Client Companion Application.

## 2. Changes

Our Services may evolve and change over time.  For this reason, we may from time to time modify, amend or vary these Terms (collectively, “**Modifications**”) to cover new Services or to comply with changes in the law.  Please check these Terms regularly to ensure you are aware of any Modifications made by us.  If you continue to use the Services, you are deemed to have accepted such Modifications.  If you do not agree to such Modifications, you should discontinue use and uninstall the App and cease using any Services. 

We may from time to time need to update the App or send fixes for any errors or bugs in the App. Such updates or fixes will occur automatically when code is committed by Parasol on both the SafeConnect site and its companion web application. For users of the mobile companion application: YOU AGREE THAT WE CAN SEND SUCH UPDATES TO THE APP DIRECTLY TO YOUR DEVICE. 

## 3. App Store Terms

The App may be available for download from one or more platforms, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (“**App Stores**”).  Your download, installation, access to or use of the App is also bound by the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the applicable App Store (“**App Store Terms**”).  If there is any conflict between these Terms and the App Store Terms, then these Terms will prevail. 

The App is independent of and is not associated, affiliated, sponsored, endorsed or in any way linked to any App Store.  You and we acknowledge that these Terms are entered into between you and us only, and not with any App Store, and we, not the App Store, are solely responsible for the App and the content thereof to the extent specified in these Terms.

You and we acknowledge that we, not the relevant App Store, are responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (ii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You and we acknowledge and agree that the relevant App Store, and that App Store’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, that App Store will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

## 4. Equipment and Devices

You are responsible for operating and maintaining the devices necessary to access the Services, including paying for any cellular data or internet access by your network provider (“**Provider**”).  You acknowledge that you may be charged by your Provider for data services while using certain features of the Services or any other third-party charges as may arise, and you accept sole responsibility for such charges.  If you are not the bill payer for the device being used to access the Services, you will be assumed to have received permission from the bill payer for using the Services.  You must also ensure that your use of the Services is not in violation of your device agreement or any wireless data service agreement.

## 5. Eligibility and Registration

You must be a resident in the United States to use the Services. If under 18, you must be using the App in connection with the receipt of services from a third-party organization that is also using the App. We make no representation or warranty that the Services are currently available for use outside of the United States. You further affirm that you are fully able and competent, or have the consent of your parent or legal guardian, to enter into these Terms, and to abide by and comply with these Terms.

You may not use another user’s account without permission. You agree to provide complete and accurate information when registering to use our Services and to keep that information updated.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password (“**User Credentials**”) and for notifying us immediately of any loss or unauthorized use of your User Credentials. You are responsible for all activities on your account whether authorized or not.

Any information provided by you to the Services will be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all information you provide is correct, current and complete. You agree that all information you provide, including but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features available through the Services is governed by the Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with the Privacy Policy.

You represent that:

- You will fully comply with all applicable laws and agreements that govern your use of the Services, including the Privacy Policy and any Data Processing Agreement or Subscription Agreement entered into between Parasol and you (as applicable); and
- You will not use the Services in violation of any law or for any fraudulent or illegal activity.

## 6. Access, Updates and Deletion of Accounts

You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services and ensuring all persons who access the Services through your internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them. If you delete your account, you will no longer be able to access or use the Services.

More information on our data removal and retention policies can be found in the Privacy Policy.

Organizational Users. Subsequent to Parasol’s creation of an initial administrative account and profile associated with a given organizational user, it is the responsibility of that organization’s administrator to create and manage its users’ login information. The organization and its agents are responsible for archiving accounts that preserve data in accordance with our Data Retention Policy.

Each organization is permitted to request the deletion of all its information—including the data of its individual users—at once. However, Parasol will not remove the data of an organization’s users on an individual basis, unless the deletion is requested directly by the user (see below). We reserve the right to make exceptions to this general policy on a case-by-case basis.

Survivor/Client Users. You may access, update or delete your account on the SafeConnect website or Client Companion Application at any time. If you wish to delete any data associated with your account, you must first submit a deletion request to Parasol. Upon receipt of your deletion request, an external verification process will be conducted, and we will then notify all organizations that you are registered with of your request via email. Thirty (30) days after receiving your request and distributing the requisite notices of removal, we will promptly remove the relevant information from our database.

## 7. Push Notifications

You acknowledge that we may need to notify users of the SafeConnect Companion App about the App or Services through the use of push notifications. These notifications may be obfuscated to provide users with the utmost safety when using the App. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to receiving such push notifications to the extent consent is required by applicable law.

Our policy is to provide individual users with full control over the notifications that they receive from us; and therefore, you can opt-out of push notifications at any time. Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Services.

## 8. Licenses

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Parasol hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use and access the Services, and the information contained therein, solely for its intended purpose and solely for your personal, non-commercial use (“**User License**”). If you access the Services on your mobile device, you may only exercise the User License on an approved Apple or Android device as permitted by the applicable App Store Terms and in accordance with these Terms.  All other rights in the Services are reserved by Parasol.  In the event of your breach of these Terms, we will be entitled to terminate the User License and your account and access to the Services immediately. 

If you provide any information, data, or other content (“**Content**”) to the Services, you hereby grant Parasol a worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, receive, reproduce, store, modify, display, process and otherwise use such Content in connection with Parasol’s provision of the Services.

Except for the rights expressly granted in these Terms, Parasol retains all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Services. No implied license or right is granted to you by estoppel, reliance or otherwise.

## 12. Third Party Links

The Services may contain links to other websites, databases, networks, servers, information, software, programs, systems, directories, applications, products or services (collectively “**External Applications**”) for your convenience.  We are not and cannot be responsible for the External Applications’ content, operation or use.  Your use of External Applications is subject to the privacy practices and terms of use established for the External Applications, and we disclaim all liability for such use.  You are solely responsible for reviewing any terms of use, privacy policy or other terms governing your use of these External Applications, which you use at your own risk.

## 14. Disclaimer of Warranties

We provide the Services on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis without any promises or representations, express or implied.  In particular, Parasol does not warrant or make any representation regarding the validity, accuracy, reliability or availability of the Services or any related content.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PARASOL HEREBY EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE APP, APP CONTENT OR SERVICES ARE OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGING, ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, OR ARE ABLE TO OPERATE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS, OR THAT THE USE OF THE APP, APP CONTENT OR SERVICES BY YOU IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU TRANSMIT IN CONNECTION WITH THE APP OR SERVICES WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY, ACCURATELY OR SECURELY TRANSMITTED.

Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between Parasol and an organizational user, the App is not intended to provide medical advice or to store any data or information that would satisfy the definition of “protected health information” as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d et seq. or would be subject to other medical privacy laws, rules or regulations.

## 15. Limitation of Liability

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY OF ANY KIND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARASOL NOR ANY OF THE INDEMNITEES ARE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF DATA) OR LIABILITIES UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE SERVICES, AND/OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES.  YOUR SOLE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, “USER” MEANS ANY USER OF THE SERVICES. PARASOL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY FOR ANY COSTS, EXPENSES, LIABILITIES, PENALTIES, FINES, LOSSES, DAMAGES, DEMANDS, THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS AND/OR OTHER FORMS OF LIABILITY, WHETHER ARISING FROM PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY, OR DEATH, OR TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOSS, OR OTHERWISE (COLLECTIVELY, “**CLAIMS**”) IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (A) ANY USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, THE SERVICES BY YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF; (B) ANY MISSTATEMENTS, INACCURACIES, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES; AND/OR (C) ANY RECOMMENDATION, ADVICE, OR OTHER ACTION BY YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF IN CONNECTION WITH VIEWING, USING OR RELYING ON THE SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL(S), REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE CLAIM(S). YOU HEREBY ASSUME AND BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING, AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE PARASOL AND EACH INDEMNITEE FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATING TO THE FOREGOING. If you are a California resident, you expressly waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:

“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”

If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine to the fullest extent permitted by law in that jurisdiction. 

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES AND/OR LIABILITIES, SO CERTAIN OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

In the event that applicable law does not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties and/or the limitation of liability for direct, indirect, consequential or other damages, in no event shall Parasol or any of the Indemnitees’ liability arising under or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Services exceed $100.

## 16. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law principles.  In the event arbitration does not apply, we and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of New York with regard to any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms.  YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION OR TO A JURY IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE THAT PROCEEDS IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

## 17. Dispute Resolution

YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND PARASOL. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION AS PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION" BELOW.

In the event of any dispute, before either you or we can initiate a legal action, unless it is for injunctive relief, each party shall first attempt to contact the other to discuss a resolution.  You must submit your claim in writing by sending an email to the email address below.  We will contact you at the email address you provide when you register to use the Services. Neither party may initiate either arbitration or other legal action for thirty (30) days after receipt of the claim. 

If we cannot resolve the matter amicably, unless you have opted out as set forth below, you and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and us arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms, the Services or the App (“Dispute”) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.  You and Parasol further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  There may be more limited discovery than in a court proceeding.  The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.  This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

You and Parasol both agree that nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court; or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. Further, nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit any claim by Parasol in a court of law for violation of its intellectual property rights.  In addition, this Dispute Resolution section does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies.  Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).

YOU AND PARASOL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Parasol agree to the contrary, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.  Any arbitration between you and Parasol will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) then in force (the “**AAA Rules**”), as modified by this arbitration provision.  You and Parasol agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).  The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the U.S., provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you or Parasol may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.

Each party shall pay arbitration fees in accordance with the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

If this arbitration provision is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in this section shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Terms.

OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION: You may opt out of the binding arbitration described in this section by sending Parasol written notice of your desire to do so by email at contact@parasolcooperative.org or regular mail at Attn: Parasol Cooperative Foundation, [INSERT ADDRESS] within thirty (30) days following the date you first use our Services or App, whichever occurs first (such notice, an “**Arbitration Opt-out Notice**”). If you don’t provide Parasol with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth above.

## 18. Mass Action Waiver

You and Parasol expressly waive the right to have any Dispute brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a mass action, and neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have any authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any mass action or to award relief to anyone but the particular individual who initiates the claim to be arbitrated. The parties also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief. The parties agree that the definition of a “Mass Action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you or Parasol are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed 50 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against the other party within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or Parasol’s behalf, and the law firm or collection of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms or this Dispute Resolution provision, this Mass Action Waiver does not prevent you or Parasol from participating in a mass settlement of claims.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver. Either party shall raise with the arbitrator or arbitration provider such a dispute within 15 days of its arising. If such a dispute arises before an arbitrator has been appointed, the parties agree that (i) a panel of three arbitrators shall be appointed to resolve only disputes concerning whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver, each party shall select one arbitrator from the arbitration provider’s roster to serve as a neutral arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall appoint a third neutral arbitrator (in the event that the parties’ arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator, the arbitration provider will select the third arbitrator); (ii) Parasol shall pay any administrative fees or costs incidental to the appointment of Arbitrators under this Mass Action Waiver provision, as well as any fees or costs that would not be incurred in a court proceeding, such as payment of the fees of the arbitrators, as well as room rental; (iii) the arbitrators shall issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law; and (iv) any further arbitration proceedings or assessment of arbitration-related fees shall be stayed pending the arbitrators’ resolution of the parties’ dispute. If the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators determines that a party has violated the Mass Action Waiver, then, in addition to any other available remedies, the other party shall have the opportunity to opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the arbitrator’s or panel of arbitrator’s decision.

## 19. Termination

These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by Parasol.  You may discontinue any further use of the App and associated Services, but these Terms will continue to apply to your use of the App and Services prior to such discontinuance.  We also may terminate or suspend these Terms, at any time, without notice and accordingly deny you access to the Services, either temporarily or permanently, for any reason, including without limitation, if at our sole discretion you fail to comply with any provision of these Terms or your use is harmful to the interests of another user of the Services.  Upon any termination of the Terms by either you or us, you must promptly uninstall the App and cease using the Services. Sections 3 and 7 through 18 will continue to apply even after the Terms or Services have been terminated or suspended.

## 20. General

These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and other policies incorporated herein, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and Parasol with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  These Terms may not be changed, waived or modified except by Parasol as provided herein or otherwise by written instrument signed by Parasol.  Neither these Terms nor any right, obligation or remedy hereunder is assignable, transferable, delegable or sublicensable by you except with Parasol’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, transfer, delegation or sublicense shall be null and void. Parasol may assign, transfer or delegate these Terms or any right or obligation or remedy hereunder in its sole discretion.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained in these Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.
