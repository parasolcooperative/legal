## Ruth Chatbot Services

### Ruth (Free Service)

When you visit our Website, you have the opportunity to engage with Ruth, an AI chatbot operated by The Parasol Cooperative and hosted on Amazon Web Services ("AWS") in the United States. Ruth is a tool implemented to improve user interaction and provide resources and information. Ruth is intended to be a resource for informational purposes only and has been designed by us to assist users in accessing materials and other useful information. **Ruth is not intended or able to provide legal services or advice and cannot connect you with emergency services or law enforcement.** Ruth's responses are provided "as is" and we make no warranties regarding their accuracy or reliability. We are not liable for any errors, omissions or damages resulting from your use of Ruth.

**Data Collection**: All information entered by you into Ruth, including your communications with the chatbot, will be recorded, processed and stored by us on AWS in the United States. **We do not intentionally collect Personal Information through Ruth conversations. We strongly advise users not to share personally identifiable information, confidential information, or sensitive details during conversations with Ruth.** We collect conversation data solely to improve the quality of Ruth and its response behavior and to better support our users.

**No Personal Information Requests**: Ruth is designed not to ask for or request any Personal Information from users. If Ruth appears to request personal details, please do not provide such information and contact us at contact at parasolcooperative dot org.

**Data Retention**: Ruth conversation data is retained for 3 days from the time each conversation ends for quality assurance purposes only, after which it is automatically deleted.

### Ruth+ Services

Ruth+ consists of two components: an organizational dashboard for subscribing organizations and an embedded chatbot service that organizations can deploy on their own websites.

#### Ruth+ Organizational Dashboard

**For Organizations**: Ruth+ organizational accounts provide access to a dashboard with analytics, user management, billing features, and other administrative tools. This dashboard is accessible only to authorized personnel from subscribing organizations.

**Data Collection**: We collect Personal Information from organizational users including names, email addresses, organizational affiliation, and login credentials necessary to provide dashboard access and associated services.

**Data Sharing with Organizations**: Organizations receive:
- **GDPR-compliant website analytics** about usage of their embedded Ruth+ implementation
- **Aggregate chat metrics** including chat counts and non-identifying chat IDs
- **Optional transcript access** for quality assurance purposes only, available for a maximum of 7 days depending on subscription level
- **No Personal Information** about end-users (individuals who use the embedded chatbot)

#### Ruth+ Embedded Chatbot

**Third-Party Deployment**: Ruth+ may be embedded by organizations on their own websites or platforms. When you interact with Ruth+ on a third-party organization's website, **the organization hosting Ruth+ on their site ("Ruth+ Customer")—not The Parasol Cooperative—is responsible for their own data collection, privacy practices, and terms of use.**

**The Parasol Cooperative's Role**: While we provide the technical infrastructure for Ruth+ hosted on AWS, **we do not control how Ruth+ Customers collect, use, store, or process information from users who interact with their embedded Ruth+ implementation.** Ruth+ Customers may have independent data collection practices beyond the conversation data processed through our infrastructure.

**Data Processing**: Conversation data from Ruth+ embedded implementations is processed through our AWS infrastructure. **We do not intentionally collect Personal Information from end-users of embedded Ruth+ implementations.**

**Limited Data Retention by Ruth+ Customers**: Ruth+ Customers may store conversation data for up to 7 days for quality assurance purposes only, depending on their subscription level.

**Your Rights**: **The Parasol Cooperative is not responsible for and expressly disclaims any liability for the data practices of Ruth+ Customers.** The privacy policy and terms of use of the organization where you are using Ruth+ will govern how your information is collected and used. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any organization before sharing information with their implementation of Ruth+.

### General Chatbot Precautions

**Voluntary Use**: The use of any Ruth chatbot service is completely voluntary and you determine what information is shared.

**Information Security Advisory**: **As you communicate with any Ruth chatbot, please refrain from sharing any confidential, sensitive, or Personal Information, such as passwords, social security numbers, full names, addresses, or detailed personal information about your situation or experiences.** 

**Limitation of Liability**: Neither The Parasol Cooperative nor any Ruth+ Customer will be liable for any Personal Information or sensitive data you voluntarily provide through your use of any Ruth chatbot service.

## Your Choices

- You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Services.

- If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt-out of receiving email information from us by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.

## Third-Party Links

The Services may contain links to third-party websites and applications (e.g., Kindful, etc.). Any access to and use of such linked websites or applications is not governed by this Privacy Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites or applications. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

We have implemented measures designed to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction; however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through the Services, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in the Services.

**Data Hosting**: Our Services are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the United States, which maintains industry-standard security practices and certifications.

## Data Retention

We retain information as long as it is reasonably necessary and relevant for our operations, and/or to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, or enforce any applicable terms of service or other agreements.

**Specific Retention Periods**:
- **Ruth conversation data**: Retained for 3 days from the time each conversation ends for quality assurance purposes only, after which it is automatically deleted
- **Ruth+ organizational account data**: Retained for the duration of the service relationship and as required for business and legal purposes
