This Contributor License Agreement (the “**Agreement**”), dated as of ___________ (the “**Effective Date**”), is by and between _____________________, (“**you**”) and The Parasol Cooperative Foundation, a Delaware corporation (“**Parasol**”).

WHEREAS, Parasol provides access to its software-as-a-service offerings to its customers (the “**Services**”);

WHEREAS, Licensee wishes to make a Contribution (as defined below) and grant to Parasol a license to such Contribution for the Services, and Parasol desires to accept such Contribution, subject to all terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, terms, and conditions set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1.       **Definitions**. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:

“**Contribution**” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by you to Parasol for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Parasol, including the Services.

“**Submitted**” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Parasol or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Parasol for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “_Not a Contribution_.”

“**Work**” means any and all Contributions Submitted by you to Parasol.

**2.**              **Grant of Copyright License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Parasol and to recipients of software distributed by Parasol a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such derivative works.

**3.**              **Grant of Patent License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Parasol and to recipients of software distributed by Parasol a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was Submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**4.**              **Representation and Warranties**. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above licenses herein. To the extent applicable, if your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Parasol, or that your employer has executed a separate agreement with Parasol. You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation. You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

**5.**              **Warranty Disclaimer**. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**6.**              **Miscellaneous**.

a.               **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.

b.              **Amendment and Modification; Waiver**. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by each party. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.

c.               **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

d.              Relationship of the Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party will have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

e.               **Governing Law**. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provisions.

f.               **Assignment**. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Parasol. Parasol may assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder without your prior written consent. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

g.              **Third-Party Original Creations**. Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to Parasol separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Su_bmitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]_”.

h.              **Changes in Material Fact**. You agree to notify Parasol in writing of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make your representations inaccurate in any respect. Such communications must be sent to Parasol at the address identified in the signature page hereto.

i.               **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement.
