Please read these Terms carefully before you begin use of any Services. **By using any of our Services, including by initiating a chat session with Ruth or Ruth+, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our associated Privacy Policy**, which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use any Services.

## 1. Our Mission

Parasol is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that is focused on building technology tools and services that help people in crisis navigate to safety. In particular, Parasol is developing technology to enhance the work of organizations that execute safety programs for vulnerable and underserved populations, especially those populations affected by domestic violence. At bottom, we are a group of survivors, advocates and technologists who believe that everyone deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment, devoid of violence and abuse (our "Mission"). All Services are designed, and all uses of the Services are intended, to be in furtherance of our Mission.

## 2. Eligibility for Service Use

The Services are offered and available to users who are 16 years of age or older and reside in the United States. We make no representation or warranty that the Services are currently available for use outside of the United States. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are fully able and competent, or have the consent of your parent or legal guardian, to enter into these Terms. You further affirm that you meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.

Any information provided by you to the Services will be subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy. You agree that all information you provide, including but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features available in the Services, is governed by the Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with the Privacy Policy.

## 3. Description of Services

### Ruth (Free Service)
Ruth is an AI chatbot available through our Website at no cost to users. Ruth provides information and resources related to safety planning and support for victims of abuse. Ruth is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the United States.

### Ruth+ (Premium Service)
Ruth+ consists of two components:

**Organizational Dashboard**: A web-based interface accessible to subscribing organizations that provides metrics, analytics, user management, billing management, and in some cases, chat transcripts and user survey data.

**Embedded Chatbot**: An AI chatbot service that organizations can embed on their own websites. To end-users, this embedded service appears and functions similarly to the free Ruth service, but it is hosted and managed through the Ruth+ infrastructure.

Ruth+ is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the United States. 

**Ruth+ Account Structure**: Ruth+ accounts are established either through organizational self-registration or through custom setup by Parasol staff. The initial account holder becomes the primary organizational contact. Individual admin users and their roles (including access permissions and responsibilities) are defined and added either by the organizational administrator or by Parasol staff. Each individual user with dashboard access is bound by these Terms regardless of how their access was created.

**Organizational Responsibility**: Organizations that subscribe to Ruth+ are fully responsible for: (i) all activities conducted through their organizational account; (ii) the conduct of all individual users they authorize to access the Ruth+ dashboard; (iii) ensuring all authorized users comply with these Terms; (iv) immediately notifying Parasol of any unauthorized access or suspected misuse; and (v) any content, data, or activities associated with their organizational account or any of their authorized users.

### Important Limitations
**Ruth and Ruth+ are not intended to provide legal advice, medical advice, or emergency services.** These are informational tools designed to provide resources and support information. **In case of immediate danger, users should contact emergency services (911) or appropriate crisis hotlines immediately.**

**AI Technology Limitations**: Ruth and Ruth+ utilize artificial intelligence technology powered by large language models (LLMs). While The Parasol Cooperative conducts extensive testing and implements safety measures in designing and deploying these services, the underlying AI technology may generate responses based on outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate training data that is beyond The Parasol Cooperative's direct control.

The Parasol Cooperative makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the quality and safety of AI responses through rigorous testing, safety protocols, and ongoing monitoring. However, users acknowledge that AI-generated responses may contain outdated resources, contact information, legal requirements, or safety information that may not reflect current conditions.

Users are strongly advised to independently verify all information provided by Ruth or Ruth+, particularly emergency contacts, legal resources, safety procedures, and time-sensitive information. The AI responses are provided for informational purposes only and should supplement, not replace, professional advice or current resource verification.

Any User Contribution you provide will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. By providing any User Contribution through the Services, you grant us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors and assigns the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material.

You represent and warrant that all of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms.

You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or contribute, and you, not Parasol, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy and appropriateness. We are not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Services.

## 10. Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination

We have the right to:
- Remove or refuse to process any User Contributions for any or no reason in our sole discretion
- Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms, including Section 11, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public or could create liability for Parasol

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy. **YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS PARASOL AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.**

Parasol is based in the state of New York in the United States. We provide the Services for use primarily by persons located in the United States, and our Services are designed to comply with United States laws and regulations. 

**International Users**: While we welcome users from around the world, we make no claims that the Services or any of their content is accessible, appropriate, or compliant with laws outside of the United States. **Users accessing the Services from outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with their local laws, including but not limited to data protection, privacy, and consumer protection regulations.** We do not represent or warrant that our Services comply with the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States.

**Data Processing**: All data collected through the Services is processed and stored in the United States in accordance with United States laws. International users acknowledge and consent to the transfer and processing of their data in the United States, which may have different data protection standards than their home jurisdiction.

Access to the Services may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Services from outside the United States, you acknowledge that you have reviewed applicable local laws and determined that your use of the Services is lawful in your jurisdiction.

## 18. Disclaimer of Warranties

You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our Services for any reconstruction of any lost data.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack, viruses or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of the Services or any items obtained through the Services or to your downloading of any material posted on them, or on any website linked to them.

Parasol hereby disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, non-infringement and fitness for particular purpose.

The foregoing does not affect any warranties which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

## 19. Indemnification

You are responsible for your activities while using the Services. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Parasol, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, third party services providers and agents (collectively, "Indemnitees") from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your breach of these Terms or your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Services' content and functionality other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Services. The Indemnitees reserve the right to control the defense and settlement of any third-party claim for which you indemnify Indemnitees under these Terms, and you will assist us in exercising such rights.

## 20. Limitation on Liability

**NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY OF ANY KIND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARASOL NOR ANY OF THE INDEMNITEES ARE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF DATA) OR LIABILITIES UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE SERVICES, AND/OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE.**

In the event that applicable law does not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties and/or the limitation of liability for direct, indirect, consequential or other damages, in no event shall Parasol or any of the Indemnitees' liability arising under or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Services exceed $100.

## 21. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law principles. In the event arbitration does not apply, we and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of New York with regard to any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms. **YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION OR TO A JURY IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE THAT PROCEEDS IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.**

## 22. Dispute Resolution

**YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND PARASOL. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION AS PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION" BELOW.**

In the event of any dispute, before either you or we can initiate a legal action, unless it is for injunctive relief, each party shall first attempt to contact the other to discuss a resolution. You must submit your claim in writing by sending an email to contact at parasolcooperative dot org. Neither party may initiate either arbitration or other legal action for thirty (30) days after receipt of the claim.

If we cannot resolve the matter amicably, unless you have opted out as set forth below, you and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and us arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or the Services ("Dispute") will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Parasol further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. **THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.** There may be more limited discovery than in a court proceeding. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

You and Parasol both agree that nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court; or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. Further, nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit any claim by Parasol in a court of law for violation of its intellectual property rights. In addition, this Dispute Resolution section does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).

**YOU AND PARASOL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.** Unless both you and Parasol agree to the contrary, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Parasol will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this arbitration provision. You and Parasol agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the U.S., provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you or Parasol may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.

Each party shall pay arbitration fees in accordance with the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

If this arbitration provision is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in this section shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Terms.

**OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION**: You may opt out of the binding arbitration described in this section by sending Parasol written notice of your desire to do so by email at contact at parasolcooperative dot org or regular mail at Attn: Parasol Cooperative Foundation, [INSERT ADDRESS] within thirty (30) days following the date you first use any of the Services, whichever occurs first (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice"). If you don't provide Parasol with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth above.

## 23. Mass Action Waiver

You and Parasol expressly waive the right to have any Dispute brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a mass action, and neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have any authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any mass action or to award relief to anyone but the particular individual who initiates the claim to be arbitrated. The parties also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief. The parties agree that the definition of a "Mass Action" includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you or Parasol are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed 50 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against the other party within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or Parasol's behalf, and the law firm or collection of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms or the Dispute Resolution provision, this Mass Action Waiver does not prevent you or Parasol from participating in a mass settlement of claims.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver. Either party shall raise with the arbitrator or arbitration provider such a dispute within 15 days of its arising. If such a dispute arises before an arbitrator has been appointed, the parties agree that (i) a panel of three arbitrators shall be appointed to resolve only disputes concerning whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver, each party shall select one arbitrator from the arbitration provider's roster to serve as a neutral arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall appoint a third neutral arbitrator (in the event that the parties' arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator, the arbitration provider will select the third arbitrator); (ii) Parasol shall pay any administrative fees or costs incidental to the appointment of arbitrators under this Mass Action Waiver provision, as well as any fees or costs that would not be incurred in a court proceeding, such as payment of the fees of the arbitrators, as well as room rental; (iii) the arbitrators shall issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law; and (iv) any further arbitration proceedings or assessment of arbitration-related fees shall be stayed pending the arbitrators' resolution of the parties' dispute. If the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators determines that a party has violated the Mass Action Waiver, then, in addition to any other available remedies, the other party shall have the opportunity to opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the arbitrator's or panel of arbitrator's decision.

Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues; otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.

## 24. General

These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and other policies incorporated herein, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and Parasol with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms may not be changed, waived or modified except by Parasol as provided herein or otherwise by written instrument signed by Parasol. Neither these Terms nor any right, obligation or remedy hereunder is assignable, transferable, delegable or sublicensable by you except with Parasol's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, transfer, delegation or sublicense shall be null and void.
