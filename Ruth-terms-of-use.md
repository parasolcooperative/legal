You are responsible for your activities on the Website. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Parasol, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, third party services providers and agents (collectively, “Indemnitees”) from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your breach of these Terms or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Website’s content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Website.

YOUR SOLE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE WEBSITE IS TO STOP USING THE WEBSITE, AS APPLICABLE.
In the event that applicable law does not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties and/or the limitation of liability for direct, indirect, consequential or other damages, in no event shall Parasol or any of the Indemnitees’ liability arising under or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Website exceed $100.

20. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law principles. In the event arbitration does not apply, we and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of New York with regard to any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION OR TO A JURY IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE THAT PROCEEDS IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

21. Dispute Resolution
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND PARASOL. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION AS PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION" BELOW.
In the event of any dispute, before either you or we can initiate a legal action, unless it is for injunctive relief, each party shall first attempt to contact the other to discuss a resolution. You must submit your claim in writing by sending an email to the email address below. Neither party may initiate either arbitration or other legal action for thirty (30) days after receipt of the claim.  
If we cannot resolve the matter amicably, unless you have opted out as set forth below, you and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and us arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or the Website (“Dispute”) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Parasol further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in a court proceeding. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.  This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.
You and Parasol both agree that nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court; or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. Further, nothing in this Dispute Resolution section will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit any claim by Parasol in a court of law for violation of its intellectual property rights. In addition, this Dispute Resolution section does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies.  Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).
YOU AND PARASOL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Parasol agree to the contrary, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Parasol will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this arbitration provision.  You and Parasol agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).  The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the U.S., provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you or Parasol may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.
Each party shall pay arbitration fees in accordance with the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
If this arbitration provision is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in this section shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Terms.
OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION: You may opt out of the binding arbitration described in this section by sending Parasol written notice of your desire to do so by email at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS] or regular mail at Attn: Parasol Cooperative Foundation, [INSERT ADDRESS] within thirty (30) days following the date you first use Website, whichever occurs first (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide Parasol with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth above.
22. Mass Action Waiver
You and Parasol expressly waive the right to have any Dispute brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a mass action, and neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have any authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any mass action or to award relief to anyone but the particular individual who initiates the claim to be arbitrated. The parties also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief. The parties agree that the definition of a “Mass Action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you or Parasol are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed 50 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against the other party within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or Parasol’s behalf, and the law firm or collection of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms or the Dispute Resolution provision, this Mass Action Waiver does not prevent you or Parasol from participating in a mass settlement of claims.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver. Either party shall raise with the arbitrator or arbitration provider such a dispute within 15 days of its arising. If such a dispute arises before an arbitrator has been appointed, the parties agree that (i) a panel of three arbitrators shall be appointed to resolve only disputes concerning whether the party bringing any claim has filed a Mass Action in violation of the Mass Action Waiver, each party shall select one arbitrator from the arbitration provider’s roster to serve as a neutral arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall appoint a third neutral arbitrator (in the event that the parties’ arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator, the arbitration provider will select the third arbitrator); (ii) Parasol shall pay any administrative fees or costs incidental to the appointment of arbitrators under this Mass Action Waiver provision, as well as any fees or costs that would not be incurred in a court proceeding, such as payment of the fees of the arbitrators, as well as room rental; (iii) the arbitrators shall issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law; and (iv) any further arbitration proceedings or assessment of arbitration-related fees shall be stayed pending the arbitrators’ resolution of the parties’ dispute. If the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators determines that a party has violated the Mass Action Waiver, then, in addition to any other available remedies, the other party shall have the opportunity to opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the arbitrator’s or panel of arbitrator’s decision.
Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Website must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues; otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.

23. General
 
These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and other policies incorporated herein, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and Parasol with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  These Terms may not be changed, waived or modified except by Parasol as provided herein or otherwise by written instrument signed by Parasol. Neither these Terms nor any right, obligation or remedy hereunder is assignable, transferable, delegable or sublicensable by you except with Parasol’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, transfer, delegation or sublicense shall be null and void. Parasol may assign, transfer or delegate these Terms or any right or obligation or remedy hereunder in its sole discretion.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained in these Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.
