## Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

   

## Data Security and Deletion

We have implemented measures designed to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction; however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through the App, and you do so at your own risk.

We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained within the App. We cannot control the actions of other users or other third parties with whom you may choose to share your information and therefore we cannot and do not guarantee that information you provide through the App will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

We retain information as long as it is reasonably necessary and relevant for our operations, and/or to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, or enforce any applicable terms of service or other agreements. Upon the request of Users or Customers, we will remove Personal Information from the App and provide a confirmation that such Personal Information has been removed from our systems; provided, that, Customer shall be responsible for deletion of User Personal Information from any of Customer’s systems. 

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account by, among other things, providing a robust password to access your mobile phone, signing off after using your phone, choosing a robust password for the App that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

## Location of Personal Information

The App is offered from and hosted in the United States. We store any personal information we collect in the United States.  If you access the App from outside the United States, you agree to the transfer of information to the United States, which may have less protections for your personal information than your jurisdiction of residence.

## Limitation of Liability

By accessing the App and/or providing us with Personal Information and other data, you expressly and unconditionally release and hold us harmless from any and all liability for any injuries, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of such information.  In addition, while we take efforts to ensure the proper and appropriate use of data by our service providers that may receive your information from us, we are not responsible for any injuries, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your information caused by those service providers.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

This Policy is current as of the “Last Updated” date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the Personal Information we have previously collected from you, we may notify you through a notice on the App or another notification method. You are responsible for periodically reviewing this Policy to check for any changes.
